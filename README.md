# Open-Source @ Jahia

Jahia has a long history of contribution to Open-Source, you will find in this repository resources to help you discover our product, its codebase and our open-source practices. 

## Licensing

Historically Jahia has been distributing its codebase under a dual licensing model, GPLv3 and our own JSEL (Enterprise) license. As the software (and the open-source) industry evolves, we are taking steps towards modernizing our practices. 

Over the past few months, we've been taking the time to review our practices and refine our Open-Source strategy moving forwards. As a result, our codebase will progressively be moving away from dual-licensing towards more permissive licenses to encourage others to contribute and build on top of our products.

In the future, our license of choice for our Open-Source codebase will be [Apache version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), with some of our front-end oriented components distributed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). 

Watch for the license file in each our repository to better understand which license currently apply to the codebase.

## Contribute

Alongside working taking place on our Open-Source strategy, we are currently actively working at revising (and clarifying) our contributing guidelines. Expect more in the coming months, in the meantime you can reach us at
