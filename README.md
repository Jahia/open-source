# Open-Source @ Jahia

Jahia has a long history of contribution to Open-Source, you will find in this repository resources to help you discover our product, its codebase, and our open-source practices. 

## Discover

Jahia GitHub organization has a fairly large number of open-source repositories, and many new ones get created every week. With the exception of some of the legacy parts of the codebase, each of our Jahia modules have their own repository, named identically (or similarly) to the module ID. 

You can also repository topics available from [Jahia Organization](https://github.com/Jahia) (right side of the screen) to quickly access the list of product modules. 

## Licenses

Historically Jahia has been distributing its codebase under a dual licensing model using GPLv3, and Jahia's JSEL (Enterprise) license. As the software (and the open-source) industry evolves, we are taking steps towards modernizing our practices. 

Over the past few months, we've been taking the time to review our practices and refine our Open-Source strategy moving forwards. As a result, our codebase will progressively be moving away from dual-licensing towards more permissive licenses to encourage others to contribute and build on top of our products.

In the future, our license of choice for our Open-Source codebase will be [Apache version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), with some of our front-end oriented components distributed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). 

Watch for the `LICENSE` file in each of our repository to better understand which license currently applies to the codebase.

## Contribute

Alongside working taking place on our Open-Source strategy, we are currently actively working at revising (and clarifying) our contributing guidelines. Expect more in the coming months.
